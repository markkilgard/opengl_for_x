# opengl_for_x
Sample Code from book "OpenGL for the X Window System"

This repo contains the on-line source code for my book "Programming OpenGL for the X Window System" (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0201483599).

Unfortunately, the ftp sites listed in Appendix A are out of date. (It's just hard to keep an ftp location from 1996 active. :-)

If you are looking for the source code from Addison-Wesley (the same code you will find here), you can still get it from the Addison-Wesley web site at this URL (still worked in December 2017!):

Note that the files are formated as Unix text files rather than DOS files. For Linux or Unix users, this should not be much of a problem, but Windows users may want to use "unix2dos" or a similar utility to make the files easily readable by DOS or Windows text editors.

Also note that the GLUT source code contained in glut.tar.Z within the downloadable ZIP file (and reproduced here) is pretty dated.

Instead please get GLUT from https://github.com/markkilgard/glut
