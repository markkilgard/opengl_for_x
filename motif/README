Welcome to the "Programming OpenGL for the X Window System" Motif-based
example source code.  The following table names each example program
directory and what section of the book discusses the example.

Section        Example directory
----------     ------------------
  3.2.1          glw
  3.4            paperplane
  6.2.9.1        new_xt_tablet (needs X11R6.1 or IRIX 6.2)
  6.2.9.2        old_xt_tablet
  7              molview

I've tried to make the Makefiles as simple and as portable as
possible.  If you find problems with these examples, please report bugs
to mjk@sgi.com
