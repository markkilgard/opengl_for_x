This file contains Unix-compressed PostScript for "The OpenGL Utility
Toolkit (GLUT) Programming Interface, API Version 3".

If you have "Programming OpenGL for the X Window System", you will find
that the book contains the same basic information covered in this
specification (in convenient book form!).
